Have you ever found yourself showing up to a session for your favourite tabletop game, only to realise that you've left your dice at home?

Well have no fear, High Roller is here!

High Roller is a fun, small dice companion built with Next.js & TypeScript that lets you roll the dice anywhere!

It's also a PWA (Progressive Web App) which means if you like you can install it to your phone straight from the browser meaning that's one less tab you have to keep open ;).

Thanks for reading this far and I hope you enjoy it!
